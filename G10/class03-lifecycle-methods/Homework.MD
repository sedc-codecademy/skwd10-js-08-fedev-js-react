# React Homework #1

## Requirements

- Using the concepts we covered so far create a view that will fetch the planets from swapi `https://swapi/dev/api/planets`
- Create a component that will list all the planets
- By clicking on one of the planet names you should show the user a details component that will list out all the specific details (the details component should start off as hidden and only show once a user clicks on a planet name)
- Create a pagination element that will have two buttons `next` and `previous`. When the user clicks on either one of them the next result set should be fetched from the backend example: `https://swapi.dev/api/planets/?page=2` and the planet list should be updated in the UI
- Make it so that when the user is on page one the previous button is disabled and when the user is on the last page the next button is disabled

Research and experiment, refer back to the code we have in class for guidance and for help.
