## Homework #2

- Using a free api of your choice create a react application that will consume that api and show the data on the front end.
- Get creative on which api you want to use, use your own css or use something like bootstrap it doesn't matter.

- The technical requirements are that your entire app uses react functional components and hooks. you can get as complex as you want with your UI but the minimum is to use the useState and useEffct hooks in multiple places.

- If your api of choice has the ability to search for data, implement a search bar
- If the api has pagination implement the pagination using useEffect and dependancy arrays
- Try to use as many conceps from class as you can but at the end focus on having something functional and useful to users.
- If you at any point feel stuck or don't know where to begin always reference the code that we wrote in class and start building step by step.
- You have time until the end of this course to finish this homework, the goal is for you guys to have a personalized react project that you can add to your portfolios and as a platform on which you practice all the things we learn in class.

- Super Bonus if you actually build the api in node (it will be reviewed as well)

- If you have any questions write us an email
