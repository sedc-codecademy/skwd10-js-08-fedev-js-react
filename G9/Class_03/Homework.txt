Create simple "NEWS" react app. It should fetch news from "https://newsapi.org/?ref=apilist.fun".
(pay atention that you need generate key from the site and use that key in the call that you will make as showed in the demo)
Take the data for "Top business headlines in the US right now" (research in the site how to get only those news).
You should save the data from the response in local state of the component and for each news you should create a card on the screen
with title, content, when it was published and image for that specific news.
Feel free to construct your own design of how the cards will look like (using library for rendering cards is allowed as well)
